The code has compile errors because the variable arr cannot be changed once it is assigned.


The code has runtime errors because the variable arr cannot be changed once it is assigned.


The code can compile and run fine. The second line assigns a new array to arr.


The code has compile errors because we cannot assign a different size array to arr.

         int n = 6;

                    n = arr[arr[n] / 2];
